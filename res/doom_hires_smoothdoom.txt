Description             : A high resolution package for Doom using AI
                          upscaled textures and sprites. Works with
                          doom.wad, doomu.wad, doombfg.wad,
                          doom2.wad, doom2bfg.wad,
                          tnt.wad, and plutonia.wad.

                          Requires the use of SmoothDoom to play. Stack
                          the IWAD, then SmoothDoom, then this hires mod.
                          
                          Provides 2x, 4x, and 8x resolutions to choose
                          from. (Bigger is not always better, larger scales
                          look different and take a longer time to load).

* Copyright / Permissions *

SmoothDoom (6/15/19) has been used as a base in this work. The SmoothDoom
contributors have not given any instructions with regard to copyright.
Creative additions provided by that project should be considered their
copyright.

This work is for the most part programmatically derived from Doom assets
and is therefore under the same copyright protection as Doom. Doom is owned
by id Software/Bethesda Softworks.

Since it contains no creative additions by myself it does not qualify as a
"derivative work" in which my contributions might themselves receive
copyright protection. I claim no copyright on the material, the copyright
is held by id Software/Bethesda Softworks.

The legality of distribution of this mod is questionable. It could be
argued that the mod requires use of an official base game to play, and
that there is an unchallenged precedent set by the modding community,
therefore Bethesda shouldn't have a problem with it. But I will certainly
comply a takedown request if Bethesda were to send one.

I would additionally comply with a takedown request from SmoothDoom
contributors, since their licensing was left ambiguous. Though I do feel
that would be deeply ironic.
