Description             : A high resolution package for Freedoom using AI
                          upscaled textures and sprites. Works with
                          freedm.wad, freedoom1.wad, and freedoom2.wad.
                          
                          Provides 2x, 4x, and 8x resolutions to choose
                          from. (Bigger is not always better, larger scales
                          look different and take a longer time to load).
                          
                          Automatically generated using the wadsnip
